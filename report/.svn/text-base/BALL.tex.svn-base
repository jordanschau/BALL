\section{Architectural Block Diagram}
Figure \ref{blockdiagram} shows the Architectural Block Diagram of the
BALL compiler. This compiler and its structures are further explained
in Section \ref{interfaces} below.

\end{figure}


\section{Interfaces between Compiler Modules}\label{interfaces}
The BALL compiler's modules can be grouped into five major steps, as
enumerated below. Reference Figure \ref{blockdiagram} for a visual
representation of the interface.
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, the lexer traverses the BALL source program to be
  compiled. The lexer gathers all of the tokens, passing them to the
  parser in the same sequence. The lexer acts in a left-to-right
  method.
\item The parser then parses the sequence according to the grammar,
  matching statements. It creates a rightmost derivation, and thus
  BALL is a LR(1) language. As the parsing goes on, and the parser
  finds matches in the grammar, it adds identifiers (variables and
  functions) to the symbol table.
\item The parser outputs a syntax tree containing nodes for each
  action (actions include print statements, assignment statements,
  expressions, etc.) Every statement has a node in the syntax tree.
\item Each node generates its own Java code equivalent, checking the
  symbol table at compilation to ensure conflicts or incorrect
  declarations or calls do not exist within the code.
\item The Java code is compile by the Java compiler into bytecode. The
  Java Virtual Machine then runs this compiled bytecode as well as the
  libraries supplied in the Java backend runtime classes. These
  libraries enable BALL's syntax simplicity.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Architecture Work Distribution}
Ultimately, as was the case for all of BALL's development, work was
divided evenly, and each member contributed massively to the completed
project by being involved in every part of the process. For example,
intermediate code generation from the syntax tree was written for
different language constructs by different members of the
team. Similarly the parser and symbol table were adapted based on
which section of code a particular team member worked on at a
particular time. Often, team members worked together to solve one
particular part of the language. Thus, each module in BALL is truly a
team effort, as no particular module can be traced to one individual
person.

BALL is the ultimate baseball language. Just as baseball is a team
sport, BALL is a team-created language.
